    <h4>THE STRONGER</h4>
    <h4>Author -- AUGUST STRINDBERG</h4>
    <p class="speech">
        SCENE: _A corner of a ladies' restaurant; two small tables of cast-iron, a sofa covered with red plush, and a few chairs._
    </p>

       <h5> MRS. X</h5> 
       <p class="speech">
        Well, how do, Millie! Here you are sitting on Christmas Eve, as lonely as a poor bachelor.
       </p>

       <h5>MRS. X</h5>
       <p class="speech">
        Really, I feel sorry to find you like this--alone--alone in a restaurant, and on Christmas Eve of all times. It makes me as sad as when I saw a wedding party at Paris once in a restaurant--the bride was reading a comic paper and the groom was playing billiards with the witnesses. Ugh, when it begins that way, I thought, how will it end? Think of it, playing billiards on his wedding day! Yes, and you're going to say that she was reading a comic paper--- that's a different case, my dear.
       </p>

       <h5> MRS. X</h5>
       <p class="speech">
        [_Sips a few spoonfuls; opens the basket and displays a number of Christmas presents._] See what I've bought for my tots. [_Picks up a doll._] What do you think of this? Lisa is to have it. She can roll her eyes and twist her head, do you see? Fine, is it not? And here's a cork pistol for Carl.
       </p>
        <h5>MRS. X</h5>
        <p class="speech">
        [Loads the pistol and pops it at MISS Y. MISS Y. starts as if frightened]
         Did I scare you? Why, you didn't fear I was going to shoot you, did you? Really, I didn't think you could believe that of me. If you were to shoot _me_--well, that wouldn't surprise me the least. I've got in your way once, and I know you'll never forget it--but I couldn't help it. You still think I intrigued you away from the Royal Theatre, and I didn't do anything of the kind--although you think so. But it doesn't matter what I say, of course--you believe it was I just the same. [Pulls out a pair of embroidered slippers.] Well, these are for my hubby--tulips--I've embroidered them myself. H'm!--I hate tulips--and he must have them on everything.
        </p>

        <h5>MISS Y</h5>
        <p class="direction">
            [looks up from the paper with an expression of mingled sarcasm and curiosity]
        </p>
        
        <h5>MRS. X</h5>
        <p class="speech">
        [Puts a hand in each slipper] Just see what small feet Bob has. See? And you should see him walk--elegant! Of course, you've never seen him in slippers.
        </p>

        <h5>MISS Y</h5>
        <p class="direction">
            [laughs aloud]
        </p>

        <h5>MRS. X</h5>
        <p class="speech">
            Look here--here he comes.
        </p>

        <h5>MISS Y</h5>
        <p class="direction">
            [Makes the slippers walk across the table. MISS Y. laughs
            again]
