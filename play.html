        Well, how do, Millie! Here you are sitting on Christmas Eve, as lonely as a poor bachelor.

       <h5>MISS_Y</h5>

        [looks up from the paper for a moment, nods, and resumes
        her reading]

       <h5>MRS_X</h5>
       <p class="speech">
        Really, I feel sorry to find you like this--alone--alone in a restaurant, and on Christmas Eve of all times. It makes me as sad as when I saw a wedding party at Paris once in a restaurant--the bride was reading a comic paper and the groom was playing billiards with the witnesses. Ugh, when it begins that way, I thought, how will it end? Think of it, playing billiards on his wedding day! Yes, and you're going to say that she was reading a comic paper--- that's a different case, my dear.

        Just see what small feet Bob has. See? And you should see him walk--elegant! Of course, you've never seen him in slippers.

            Look here--here he comes.
        </p>

            again]
